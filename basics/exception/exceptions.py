# In Python, thereâ€™re two main kinds of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.
# Even though when your code has valid syntax, it may cause an error during execution.
# In Python, errors that occur during the execution are called exceptions
#In Python, exceptions have different types such as TypeError, NameError, etc.

except Exception:

else: #(optional)

finally: #(optional)
