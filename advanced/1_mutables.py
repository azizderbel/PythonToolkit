# In Python, everything is an object. An object has its own internal state. Some objects allow you to change their internal state and others don’t.

# An object whose internal state can be changed is called a mutable object
# like lists,sets,dictionaries
# An object whose internal state cannot be changed is called an immutable object
# like Numbers,Strings,Tuples,Frozen sets


# The reassignment doesn’t change the value of the first integer object. It just reassigns the reference.
