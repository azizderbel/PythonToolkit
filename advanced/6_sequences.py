#A sequence is a positionally ordered collection of items
#Python has the following built-in sequence types: 
#lists, bytearrays, strings, tuples, range, and bytes. 
#Python classifies sequence types as mutable and immutable.

#The mutable sequence types are lists and bytearrays 
#while the immutable sequence 
#types are strings, tuples, range, and bytes.


# Any sequence is iterable. For example, a list is iterable.
# However, an iterable may not be a sequence type. For example, a set is iterable but itâ€™s not a sequence
# Generally speaking, iterables are more general than sequence types.
